encryption vs cryptography

symetric(same key for encryption and decryption) vs asymetric cryptography

digital signature: reverse of asymetric
	sender uses his own private key, and reciever uses his public key
	non-repudition can be achieved using this

ceaser cipher(alphabets shifting, multiple shifting - 2 time, 3 time etc ), substitution, alphabets, 	
fast is symetric. issue is key should be same for reciever and sender
internet uses symetric encryption
sending key on network to recipient is big issue
key is send as asymetic way remaining msg is send in symetric way
data is most imp. it should not travel as plain text, it should be encrypted

algorithms are not certified that is as per standard or unbreakable
some algos are commercially available
nothing is unbreakable
most imp is key not algorithm
check history of developers while purchasing algos

-------------------------------------------
HASHING
--------------------------
it is irreversible
if hash made of file then file cannot be made with its hash.
digital evidences,
when a file is changed then its hash also changes. Which is helpfull in Cyber forenzik.
User Cridentials in websites are converted to the hash if similar then login the user else wrong user.

Rod: for encryption and decryption
