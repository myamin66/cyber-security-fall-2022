SQL Injection and cross site scripting working with example 
.....
SQL Injection:
.....
It is a code injection technique used to execute the malicious SQL statements.
OR
It is an attack used to take over database servers by dynamically poisining sql queries. 
....
How SQL Injection works
.....
select * from users
where username='abc@xyz.com'
and password='123456'

        |
	|
       \ /

select * from users where username='OR 1=1--'
and 
password='123456'

Entering “100 OR 1=1” in the query input box will return a response with the details of a table.

"OR ""="
This SQL injection approach is similar to the above. A bad actor needs to enter "OR ""=" into the query input box. 
These two signs serve as the malicious code to break into the application. Consider the following example.
An attacker seeks to retrieve user data from an application and can simply type “OR=” in the user ID or password.
As this SQL statement is valid and true,it will return the data of the user table in the database.

........
Cross site Scripting
....
It is a code injection attack executed on the clinet side of a 
web application
...
..> attacker inject malicious script through web browser
..> the malicious script is executed when the victim visits the web page 
..> Steal cookies , sesion tokens and other sensitive information
..> modify the content of the website

       Victim    Hacker

An attacker inject client side script into web pages viewed by other users.
oR
Cross-site scripting works by manipulating a vulnerable web site so that it returns malicious JavaScript 
to users. When the malicious code executes inside a victim's browser, the attacker can fully compromise their 
interaction with the application.
