DoS vs DDoS attack
types of dos attacks
	1) SYN Floods
		TCP/IP oriented is connection oriented.
		Client send Syn request, server allocate some resources and sends syn+response but client dont acknowlege. Server keeps waiting and no connection completes. when legitmite user sends SYN request, buffer will already full.
		Direct SYN attack vs IP spoofing (source Ip address is changed to hide the identitiy while doing the DoS attack. )
		Sniffing:  packet Sniffing is listening in on other people's communications. Packet Spoofing is the dynamic presentation of fake network traffic that impersonates someone else.
		Botnet: a full network of compromised PCs. Syn and other attacks performed throudh these Pcs
